That doesn't mean that we would water down the content. We will try and balance the theory and practice while giving more preference to the practical and applied aspects of AI as the course name suggests. Through the course, we will work on 20+ case studies of real world AI problems and datasets to help students grasp the practical details of building AI solutions. For each idea/algorithm in AI, we would provide examples to provide the intuition and show how the idea to used in the real world.",

Whether you\u2019re a student, entrepreneur, or seasoned programmer, the right abstraction can make all the difference.\n\nI make videos on:\n\n1. Choosing the right abstraction.\n2. Reducing complexity without losing flexibility.\n3. Decision-making tools for scalable code.\n4. When and why to make trade-offs.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a question, challenge, or story, email me\u2014I\u2019d love to hear from you.\n\nNote: Some links on this channel are affiliate links.

I started FusedVR started back in 2016 as a fun way to learn about building VR / AR prototypes with an HTC Vive and posting those tutorials to Youtube. The more I work with these technologies, the more I get excited about the possibilities for VR and AR to help us experience the unexperienceable, improve productivity, and open the door to new opportunities. Throughout this journey, I have also come to realize there are many tangential upcoming technologies from Blockchain to 5G Edge Computing that have the potential to solve many of the difficult commercial & political challenges that VR and AR will inevitably occur just like previous generations. To that end, I am excited to see how they will all intersect and working towards enabling collaboration between these developer communities.",

Answering people\u2019s questions is great, and the feeling you get when you solve a problem always felt good. The only problem I have is making tutorials is a little bit time consuming. It requires planning the subjects that need to be covered, recording the tutorial, editing the video, rendering it and finally uploading it on YouTube. \nSo I need your help in Collecting All the codes at one place. I made a website Codebind.com for sharing my code and other programming stuff. But I alone can not do this. So Ask you guys to become contributor to this site. Just Share the code Which you learn by watching Programming Knowledge or You can simply share your Programming Knowledge with others.\nWhat is your Benefit?\n1 - Together we can collect all the codes of All my videos and share it with others.\n2 - Sharing Knowledge is the biggest learning. By sharing You can understand the concepts better.\nCodeBind.com",

I'm known as a passionate software developer who is always looking to learn something new. In 2010, I started my career as a .NET web programmer. Four years later, I was given the opportunity to work on Java projects. I was thrilled by the idea of learning a new programming language so I jumped right in. Today, I love developing cool apps in C#, Java, and JavaScript. In 2016, I created my blog and YouTube channel, where I publish tutorials, tips, and thoughts on software development and technology. I am thrilled when my articles and tutorials help someone learn new things.\n\n\u26ab Say hi\n\nI am always looking forward for your ideas, comments and thoughts. So, don't hesitate to reach me either in the comments section of my videos or on social media \ud83d\ude09",

I went from a broke dropout working at McDonalds to making $100k+/month as a developer, travelling the world and moving to Dubai all before the age of 22. I've since helped thousands of aspiring developers land their first software engineering role and assisted mid-level devs land jobs at companies like google.\n\nMax landed his first developer job 3 weeks after going through my training.\nYoussef was laid off and landed a new role in 2 months while working with me.\nJamario landing competing job offers before graduating college.\n\nIf you want to learn more you can click the first link and watch my free training on how we help developers who already know how to code get hired by top tech companies.\n",

      "description": "Sayef Reyadh \u2013 Programming Made Simple\n\nI started this channel back in my university days, eager to make Computer Science and programming concepts simple and accessible for students like me. Teaching and helping others quickly became my passion, and I spent 1.5 years as a University Lecturer, guiding hundreds of students through the challenges of core CS subjects.\n\nAfter that, I transitioned into the software industry, where I\u2019ve now spent nearly 5 years building real-world systems that are used by millions of users. Today, as a Senior Software Engineer, I continue my teaching passion on this channel, sharing tutorials, coding tips, and practical insights to help undergraduate CS students in Bangladesh and beyond learn faster, smarter, and with confidence.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a beginner struggling with your first lines of code or a student preparing for interviews, this channel is here to make programming simple and enjoyable, because learning should never be complicated.\n\n\u00a9Sayef Reyadh.\n",
